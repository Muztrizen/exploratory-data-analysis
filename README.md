### Univariate Analysis
1. Find missing values in datasets
2. Distribution of target feature
3. Distribution of target feature + fitting with distribution (Seaborn)

### Bivariate Analysis

### Multivariate Analysis
* Correlation pairplot using Seaborn
* Distribution of features
* Correlation between features & target feature
